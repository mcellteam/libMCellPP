# API prototype 2020

## Contents

* [cpp_subscriber_observer](cpp_subscriber_observer) (Oliver): Example of subscriber/observer pattern in C++, and wrapped in Python using pybind11.
* [oliver_synaptic_calcium_basic](oliver_synaptic_calcium_basic) (Oliver): A basic example of how we may want the API to look based on Tom's synaptic calcium model.
* [oliver_synaptic_calcium_full](oliver_synaptic_calcium_full) (Oliver): An incomplete fancier workup of Tom's synaptic calcium model. The goal here is a full model in C++, wrapped into Python with pybind11, that looks and feels good in both worlds.
* [swig_examples](swig_examples) (Oliver): some misc. SWIG codes. But we should use pybind11!
